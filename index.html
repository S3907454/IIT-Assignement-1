										<h2 class="major">Personal Profile </h2>
										<p>I am fourth generation Australian, though with a last name such as mine, it is not surprising that we have kept close ties to our Scottish heritage. My brothers and I can now also go by the title of Laird (Lord) of Glencoe and Lochaber. Though this is obviously nothing too serious. Scotland has this program where you can purchase square metres of land to help preserve and return previous agricultural land back to the original wild forests.  It does make you feel more connected to our ancestors even though we are so far removed from the homeland both in distance and generations.
Though throughout my working career I have obtained various certificates focusing on the office administrative environment, the highest official complete education I have achieve is the Senior Certificate from High School.
As much as I love the comforts and conveniences of the city life, I do love camping and getting away from it all.  I have a great affinity with the bush over going to the beach. Sun, sand, salt, no thank you.  Being in the mountains amongst the trees especially in the cooler months is such a recharged to the system both mentally and physically.

										<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
										<p>I have always had an interest in technology, from medical and physics to mechanical and astronomical. Though I may not fully understand the research, the implementation, and the advancement they provided I have always found fascinating. Always move forward, learn from the past but do not get stuck there.
This interest started back when I was a kid watching all the afternoon cartoons and sci-fi shows and movies. The reliance on providing the actual science behind such fanciful stories was not called for at that time and so your imagination could just open up and run wild.  From Astroboys flying cars and video phones, to Starwars space travel and floating cities.
My current IT experience has only been limited to working as an administrator. In this position I was a huge end user, as are most people nowadays, but also, due to my interest was the go-to guy for the setting up of pcs, small cable adjustments in the server room and trouble shooting before staff would then go to the IT help desk for more serious issues.  Personally wise, my experience is gaming. MMOs mostly with some shooters and city builders.
Unfortunately, RMIT was not my first choice. As I am from Queensland, and centrally at that, I was looking at UCQ and James Cook. But due to their limitation with providing online learning, I did some further research and found RMIT via OUA.  Being in the regions, having the option to do this course fully online was ideal. Again, further testament to the wonders and advancement of technology, distance and remoteness is no longer a disadvantage to receiving great education.
As I mentioned earlier, I am a great end user of technology, so with doing this course I am hoping to move into being at the forefront and contribute to the emerging technologies, essentially completing the loop.  Be if from programming a far more efficient business database system or assisting on a scientific research team adapting programs and equipment on the go.  Learning the basics, the roots, of IT would set me up to help future proof my job prospects. As IT changes very rapidly so from the knowledge and skills obtain form this course will help me adapt quicker to the very transforming industry.

										<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
										<p>The ideal job that I would strive towards would be as an IT Officer with the Australian Antarctic Program.
This would entail the management, implementation and maintenance of the IT systems required for the scientific research being conducted at the Australian Antarctic stations.  Not being an actual scientist does not mean we cannot be part of one of the worlds latest and ongoing research endeavours.  
Short of space travel and exploration, working in Antarctica would be a great adventure, seeking new knowledge of our planets past, gathering information of the planets’ current environmental status, even using the non-polluted skies above to explore ever further into outer space.  
To be able to say that you had worked on such projects with the great scientist of the day would be a true honour not only for myself but also to my family.
Due to the remoteness of the position, being able to adapt and troubleshoot with high efficiency would be a great benefit as resources and further support could be over a month away, even longer pending weather conditions.
Having several years of experience with IT, in particular networking and troubleshooting would be ideal.  Experience in a large company with a complex IT system, I believe, would suit ideally. Even better would be to get the chance to work with other science teams, perhaps at a university, CSIRO or Bureau of Meteorology.  
Currently my experience is greatly lacking to which I hope this course will help set me up on the right path.  Though I have worked for a large organisation being the Queensland Government and had to assist in the administrative management of up to 3 departments in the same location at once, providing me with some of the complexity experience needed.  My IT experience would be not sufficient for this job requirements.
So, with my success of obtaining my IT degree in 3 years and my experience with working for the Queensland Government for almost 20 years. I would hope to find a position with a company to get some real-world experience to add to my profile.  I would like to prove myself to the company and stay at the one job to show stability for at least 3 to 5 years all the while keeping my eye on the Antarctica job site for when they advertise again for this position.

									<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
									<p>H.I.V.E (Higher Integrated Vehicular Equipment)
Drones on a hive program to assist in preventative and reactionary search and rescue.
-	Lost bush walkers
-	Lost scuba diver tourists
-	Lost fishermen
-	Assisting lifeguards on patrol
-	Bush fire safety patrols assist early fire breakouts.
Idea is to have a lightweight frame attached to the bottom of emergency helicopters that can carry up to 3 drones that when released can connect with each other and the helicopter to widen the search area. The drones could also carry a inflatable lift jacket or device to deploy for the lost persons to use until the helicopter can arrive
Again, a frame attached to fire crews trucks than when released can connect with each other and the truck to cover a wider area.  The drones could have smaller water tanks and with their numbers (pending on the truck) could start releasing water over smaller embers before they get too out of control in particular in areas that are harder to reach for the firemen. Ensuring their own safety.
Lifeguards could, when they notice a distressed swimmer, release a drone from their vehicle or lookout to head straight for the swimmer marked by laser pointer in the binoculars, also carrying a inflatable device while the lifeguard can get to their vehicle or get to the surf and swim out to the swimmer.
The general purpose of this tech is to save valuable time it the search component of these situations be it either with a immediate wider search area or reaching the distressed persons and provided some survivable equipment such as inflatables until manned help can arrive.
With the fire fighters, having drones on patrol with some fire extinguisher component attached this could help the prevention of great fires and ensure the safety of the firemen themselves on the remoteness and difficult terrain of the bush.
